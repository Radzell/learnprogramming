Day 0: Expectations & Setup
===========================

"Python is not the main point of this [class]. Rather, Python is used to illustrate fundamental principles of design and programming that apply in any language or computing environment"

LPTHW: `Chapter 0<http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/ex0.html>`


Outline
-------

 * Intro to the class
   - Welcome
   - Expectations
     * Guiding vs teaching
       - how this used to be taught
       - approach to this class
     * Do the homework when you can
     * Be regular
     * Help eachother
     * Respect work day boundaries
     * **Don't be THAT guy!**: practice patience and tolerance - no man left behind
     * Ask questions early and often
     * Participate in Dojos
   - Poll for peoples expectations
   - How to succeed
     * Do the homework. 10,000 hours is real.
     * Decide early what you want to get out of it
     * **Don't get caught in the weeds**, practice suspending belief
     * Rely early and often on your new community. Programming is hard. Internalizing 
       frustration is a key mistake. Take a breath, grab a beer, and pair up.
     * Be aware of (and resist) bad developer culture
 * What does it all mean?
   - Programming, Developing, Computer Science - Oh my!
   - It's not just http... games, bioinformatics processing, number crunching, graphics,
     databases, site avaiablility, duct tape, algorithm development, networking, ai, 
     embedded systems, 
   - Many ways to use skills
     * New career, teach kids, push harder in current career, etc
   - Skills to hone depends on where you go
     * The math issue addressed and the importance of basic logic
   - Generalization vs specialization
   - Hacker schools vs college degrees
 * What is Python?
   - What does it mean to be a programming language? 
   - Basic computing stack (whiteboard FUN!)
     * Breaking down to the hardware
     * Abstractions: languages building on eachother
       - JARGON: explaining binary
     * What we read, what the machine wants
 * Basic shell commands, opening the CLI
   - basic shell navigation: cd, pwd, ls, mkdir 
   - calculator & the console
   - hello world
