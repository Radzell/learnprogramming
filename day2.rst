Version Control, If statements, Loops
=====================================

"Code is read much more often than it is written" ~ Guido Von Rossum


Outline
-------

 * History: Guido, the BDFL
 * Comments - howto and style
 * Printing and %s notation - %s, %d, %.2f
   - old vs new notation
   - `https://docs.python.org/2/library/string.html#formatstrings`
 * Printing \n, \r, \t
 * If, elif, else
 * input
 * for, while, break, continue
 * pep8, flaking, linting - Oh my!
 * BASIC intro to pip and package management

If time:
 * Shell: pipe, grep, cat, tail, man
 * Intro to version control


Homework
--------

 * `LPTHW <http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/>`_ chapters 5,7,8,10
 * Read from Zelle: 2.5 - 2.7, exercises 5-10
 * Dive into python: `Formatting strings <http://www.diveintopython.net/native_data_types/formatting_strings.html>`_
 * Hook up `Sublime <https://github.com/SublimeLinter/SublimeLinter-pyflakes>`_ (or whatever) with pyflakes, pylint
 * Shell: pipe, grep, cat, tail, man `http://cli.learncodethehardway.org/book/`
 * Ask eleddy for access to a file. Make comments on style (pep8) in github. 
   Open an issue, and assign the fixes to a fellow classmate. Next week we learn about
   version control and how to fix them.
