Most of the oral material will be from 
http://www.amazon.com/Python-Programming-Introduction-Computer-Science/dp/1887902996

Most homework will be from
http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/

If you miss a class, at minimum keep up with Learn Python the Hard way. 


Goals
-----

 * Introduce you to basic programming concepts and jargon (push back on bugs/fixes more often with better vocabulary)
 * Give you some basic hacking tools for work and home (automate simple tasks that make your day redundant)
 * Learn the basics of web APIs and how to wrangle them to your pleasure (bugsnag not reporting what you want? make it your servant)
 * Have fun and potentially discover a new passion (w00t!)


Technical Topics Covered
------------------------

 * Python
 * Command Line Tools
 * Version Control (specifically, Git)
 * Computer Science fundamentals
 * HTTP Fundamentals
 * Logic
 * Culture

End Game
--------

We will do a lot of coding, but we will work towards the following tasks:

 * Hack on PGbot
 * Parse and compute CSVs
 * Connect to APIs, such as bugsnag, and make sense of what comes back
